# Advanced Trading Strategy Orchestration

## Overview
The GoldenSignalsAI strategy orchestration system provides a comprehensive, machine learning-powered approach to options trading signal generation.

## Key Components

### 1. Advanced Strategy Orchestrator
- Multi-agent architecture
- Dynamic strategy weighting
- Real-time risk assessment
- Machine learning signal generation

### 2. Feature Engineering
- Advanced market data feature extraction
- Statistical and machine learning-based feature generation
- Supports multiple data sources

### 3. Risk Management
- Neural network-based risk prediction
- Options-specific risk analysis
- Adaptive strategy optimization

## Strategy Types

1. **Pairs Trading**
   - Exploits price deviations between correlated assets
   - Statistical arbitrage approach

2. **Momentum Strategy**
   - Uses Relative Strength Index (RSI)
   - Identifies trend continuation patterns

3. **Volatility Breakout**
   - Detects price breakouts using Bollinger Bands
   - Capitalizes on market volatility

4. **Machine Learning Strategy**
   - Neural network-based signal generation
   - Adaptive learning from market conditions

## Usage Example

```python
from strategies.advanced_orchestrator import AdvancedStrategyOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = AdvancedStrategyOrchestrator()

# Process market data
results = await orchestrator.process_market_data(market_data)

# Access trading signals and insights
final_signal = results['final_trading_signal']
risk_assessment = results['risk_assessment']
```
