### 1. **Complete Frontend Redesign** 
- Removed all trading/portfolio features
- Implemented golden theme throughout
- Created 8 new AI-focused pages
- Built 15+ reusable components
- Established unified design system

### 2. **Core Pages Implemented**
- **AI Command Center** (`/command-center`) - Live consensus visualization, agent status grid
- **Signal Stream** (`/signals`) - Real-time signal feed with advanced filtering
- **AI Assistant** (`/ai-assistant`) - Natural language chat interface
- **Signal Analytics** (`/analytics`) - Performance charts and metrics
- **Model Dashboard** (`/models`) - ML model monitoring and management
- **Market Intelligence** (`/intelligence`) - Sentiment and pattern analysis
