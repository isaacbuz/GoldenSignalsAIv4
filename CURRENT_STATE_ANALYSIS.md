# GoldenSignalsAI - Current State Analysis & Action Plan

## What We've Accomplished So Far

### 1. **Chart Evolution Journey**
- Started with basic charts using various libraries
- Created multiple implementations (15+ chart components)
- Experimented with Yahoo Finance style, Robinhood style
- Finally created **FocusedTradingChart** - a clean, professional implementation
- Key decision: Focus on ONE chart that works perfectly

### 2. **Current Working State**
- **FocusedTradingChart**: Clean implementation with price, RSI, MACD panels
- **Live Data**: WebSocket connection + periodic refresh
- **Real Backend**: FastAPI with multi-agent system
- **AI Infrastructure**: 9+ specialized agents using LangGraph

### 3. **Technical Debt Identified**
- Too many chart components (need cleanup)
- Import errors in some files
- WebSocket endpoint mismatches
- Duplicate implementations

## The Vision (From Master Documentation)

GoldenSignalsAI is an **enterprise-grade AI-powered trading signal intelligence platform** that:
- Leverages 30+ specialized AI agents
- Provides institutional-grade analysis
- Focuses on high-confidence trading signals
