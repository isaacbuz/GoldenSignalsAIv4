## Integration Testing Framework

### Test Categories:

1. **Data Flow Integration**
   - Tests complete workflow from market data to execution
   - Validates all components communicate correctly
   - Ensures data transformations are accurate

2. **Parallel Processing**
   - Verifies multi-symbol processing
   - Tests concurrent MCP server calls
   - Validates async/await implementation

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Tests retry mechanisms
   - Validates failover capabilities
   - Ensures graceful degradation

4. **Latency Requirements**
   - Monitors component response times
   - Validates SLA compliance
   - Identifies performance bottlenecks

5. **Stress Testing**
   - Tests system under high load
   - Validates scalability
   - Measures throughput limits

## Running Integration Tests

### Local Testing:
```bash
# Run integration tests locally
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh

# Run with coverage report
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --coverage
```

### Docker Testing:
```bash
# Run integration tests in Docker
./scripts/run_integration_tests.sh --docker

# Or use docker-compose directly
docker-compose -f docker-compose.integration-test.yml up
```

### Manual Testing:
```bash
# Run specific test
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_rag_agent_mcp_integration.py::TestRAGAgentMCPIntegration::test_data_flow_integration -v
```

## Monitoring Integration

### Prometheus Metrics:
- MCP server health status
- Request latencies
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

### Grafana Dashboards:
- Real-time system performance
- Historical trends
- Alert visualization

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions Ready:
```yaml
- name: Run Integration Tests
  run: |
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.integration-test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
    docker cp goldensignals_integration-tests_1:/app/test_results ./test_results
```
