RSI Agent and other technical agents fail to instantiate due to missing abstract methods from BaseAgent.

## Error
```
TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class RSIAgent with abstract methods analyze, get_required_data_types
```

## Root Cause
The BaseAgent class has abstract methods that aren't implemented in child classes:
- `analyze()`
- `get_required_data_types()`

## Solution
1. Implement the missing abstract methods in RSIAgent
2. Update all other agent classes that inherit from BaseAgent
3. Ensure proper method signatures match the base class

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All agent classes can be instantiated
- [ ] RSI agent tests pass
- [ ] No abstract method errors
