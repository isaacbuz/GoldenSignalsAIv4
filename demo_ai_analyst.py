## Risk Assessment: SPY Call Options Position

### Current Market Conditions
- **VIX**: 14.5 (Low volatility environment)
- **IV Rank**: 25th percentile (Options relatively cheap)
- **Market Regime**: Trending with low volatility

### Position Risk Metrics
Assuming ATM calls with 30 DTE:
- **Delta Risk**: 0.55 (Moderate directional exposure)
- **Theta Decay**: -$125/day accelerating near expiration
- **Vega Risk**: Low due to low IV environment
- **Gamma Risk**: Increases significantly near expiration

### Scenario Analysis
1. **Bull Case (+2% in 5 days)**: +$450 profit (180% return)
2. **Base Case (flat)**: -$125 loss (50% loss from theta)
3. **Bear Case (-2%)**: -$200 loss (80% loss)

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
1. **Spread Strategy**: Convert to call spread to reduce theta
2. **Time Management**: Exit before final week to avoid gamma risk
3. **Position Sizing**: Limit to 2-3% of portfolio for options
