# Quick Action Summary - Code Quality Improvements

## Immediate Actions (Do Now)

### 1. Code Organization (5 minutes)
```bash
# See what would be reorganized (dry run)
python refactor_code_organization.py

# Execute the reorganization
python refactor_code_organization.py --execute
```

### 2. Type Safety Analysis (2 minutes)
```bash
# Scan for missing type hints
python add_type_hints.py --report --suggest 10

# Generate type stub files
python add_type_hints.py --generate-stubs
```

### 3. Test Infrastructure (5 minutes)
```bash
# Set up test infrastructure
python setup_tests.py
# Answer 'y' when prompted to install dependencies
```

## What Each Action Does

### Code Organization
- ✅ Creates clean service/repository/interface structure
- ✅ Consolidates 5 duplicate signal generators into 1
- ✅ Sets up dependency injection
- ✅ Archives legacy code safely

### Type Safety
- ✅ Identifies all functions without type hints
- ✅ Generates type definitions for common patterns
- ✅ Creates TypedDict definitions for data structures
- ✅ Shows you exactly where to add types

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Creates complete test directory structure
- ✅ Sets up pytest with async support
- ✅ Provides test fixtures and utilities
- ✅ Adds Makefile targets for easy testing

## Quick Wins (Next 30 minutes)

### Step 1: Run Code Organization
```bash
python refactor_code_organization.py --execute
```

### Step 2: Check Type Coverage
```bash
python add_type_hints.py --report
```

### Step 3: Set Up Tests
```bash
python setup_tests.py
```

### Step 4: Run Your First Test
```bash
# After setup, run the sample tests
pytest tests/unit/services/test_signal_generation.py -v
```

### Step 5: Check Coverage
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html
open htmlcov/index.html  # View coverage report
```

## Expected Results

After these actions:
- **Code Organization**: Clean, maintainable structure
- **Type Safety**: Know exactly where to add types
- **Test Coverage**: Ready to write and run tests

## Clean Up
```bash
# After running the scripts, remove them
rm refactor_code_organization.py add_type_hints.py setup_tests.py
```

## Next Steps
1. Add type hints to top 10 functions identified
2. Write tests for critical signal generation logic
3. Gradually refactor code to use new structure
