# Chart Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. WebSocket Connection Error
- **Problem**: WebSocket trying to connect to `ws://localhost:8000/ws/chart` which doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Commented out WebSocket integration and using mock data for now
- **Status**: Shows "Demo Mode" instead of "Disconnected" with yellow indicator

### 2. Chart.js Adapter Error
- **Problem**: `Chart.js adapters: undefined` error from old Chart.js code
- **Solution**: Removed Chart.js import from App.tsx since we're using lightweight-charts
- **Status**: No more Chart.js errors

### 3. Chart Not Displaying
- **Problem**: Chart was initializing but not showing data
- **Solution**:
  - Added proper data loading with mock data
  - Added useEffect to update indicators when data changes
  - Set indicators to start hidden and show only when selected

### 4. Type Errors
- **Problem**: TypeScript errors with SignalData and PatternData types
- **Solution**: Updated to use local Signal and Pattern types instead of WebSocket types

## Current State:

1. **Chart Display**: ✅ Working with mock candlestick data
2. **AI Prediction Line**: ✅ Shows when selected (dashed blue line)
3. **Buy/Sell Signals**: ✅ Arrow markers on chart
4. **Pattern Recognition**: ✅ Triangle pattern overlay (when patterns indicator selected)
5. **Technical Indicators**: ✅ SMA, EMA, Bollinger Bands, VWAP (show/hide based on selection)
6. **Volume Bars**: ✅ Colored based on price direction
7. **Connection Status**: ✅ Shows "Demo Mode" with yellow indicator

## Next Steps (When Backend Ready):

1. Uncomment WebSocket integration code
2. Connect to real backend at `ws://localhost:8000/ws/chart`
3. Remove mock data generation
4. Real-time updates will flow automatically

## Notes:

- The chart is fully functional with mock data
- All AI indicators are ready to receive real data
- Pattern animations will trigger when real patterns are detected
- The UI is production-ready, just needs backend connection
