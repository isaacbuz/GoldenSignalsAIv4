The chart is now a pure visualization of AI intelligence, not a manual analysis tool. Users can verify the AI's analysis using external tools like TradingView if desired, but the focus is on showcasing what the AI sees and predicts in real-time.

All drawing, pattern recognition, and signal generation is handled automatically by the AI, creating a streamlined experience where users can trust the AI's analysis without needing to perform manual technical analysis.
