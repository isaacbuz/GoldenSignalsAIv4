# Chart Testing Status

## Current Status: ✅ READY FOR TESTING

### Services Running:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000/ ✅
- **Backend**: http://localhost:8000/ ✅
- **Database**: Connected with 6118 signals ✅

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ Duplicate Watermark declaration - FIXED
2. ✅ TypeScript error with indicators type mismatch - FIXED
3. ✅ Added missing calculateATR and calculateBollingerBands functions
4. ✅ Fixed MACD structure to match expected interface

### Features Implemented:
1. **Watermark**: Shows symbol + "GoldenSignalsAI" in center
2. **Main/Compare Tabs**: Switch between single and multi-symbol analysis
3. **Search & Analyze**:
   - Search bar with symbol input
   - Analyze button that triggers AI predictions
4. **AI Integration**:
   - Real-time predictions from backend
   - Support/resistance levels
   - Buy/sell signals with tiny arrows
   - Pattern detection
5. **Indicators Dropdown**: Select from AI and technical indicators
6. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live price updates
7. **AI Accuracy Panel**: Shows historical accuracy and confidence

### How to Test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser
2. Navigate to the chart component
3. Enter a symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "TSLA", "GOOGL")
4. Click the "Analyze" button
5. Observe:
   - Chart loads with candlesticks
   - Watermark appears in background
   - AI predictions show as dashed line
   - Support/resistance levels display
   - Buy/sell signals appear as arrows
   - No full chart refresh on updates

### Expected Behavior:
- Chart should load smoothly without console errors
- Watermark should be visible but subtle (5% opacity)
- Analyze button should show loading state then display predictions
- Price updates should be smooth without flickering
- Timeframe selector should update chart data
- Indicators dropdown should toggle visual elements

### Next Steps:
1. Test in browser and verify all features work
2. Check browser console for any runtime errors
3. Verify AI predictions are accurate and match price movement
4. Test comparison mode with multiple symbols
5. Ensure smooth real-time updates without full redraws
