# ✅ Fixed Duplicate Function Declarations

## Error Fixed
```
AITradingChart.tsx:1347 Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'drawMovingAverage' has already been declared
```

## Root Cause
During the implementation of multiple chart features, several functions were accidentally declared multiple times:

1. **`drawMovingAverage`** - Declared at lines 602 and 1516
2. **`drawBollingerBands`** - Declared at lines 1047 and 1529

## Solution Applied
✅ **Removed duplicate declarations while keeping the better implementations:**

### Kept the Enhanced Versions:
- **`drawMovingAverage`** (line 602) - Has glow effects and better styling
- **`drawBollingerBands`** (line 1047) - Has gradient fills and transparency

### Removed the Duplicates:
- Simple `drawMovingAverage` (line 1516) - Removed
- Basic `drawBollingerBands` (line 1529) - Removed

## Result
- ✅ No more syntax errors
- ✅ Chart loads successfully
- ✅ All enhanced visual effects preserved
- ✅ Frontend accessible at http://localhost:3000

The chart now works perfectly with all the beautiful enhancements intact!
