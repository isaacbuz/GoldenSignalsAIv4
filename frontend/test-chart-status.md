## âœ… Chart Implementation Complete

### Backend Status
- Server running on port 8000
- Health check: OK
- Database connected
- Total signals: 6033

### Frontend Status
- Server running on port 3000 (or 5173)
- Chart components updated

### Key Features Working:
1. **Watermark Restored** - Shows symbol + "GoldenSignalsAI"
2. **Main/Compare Tabs** - Switch between single and multi-symbol analysis
3. **Analyze Button** - Triggers AI prediction
4. **AI Accuracy Display** - Shows historical accuracy and confidence
5. **Real-time Updates** - WebSocket integration
6. **Indicator Selection** - Dropdown for choosing indicators

### How to Test:
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
2. Navigate to the chart
3. Enter a symbol (e.g., "AAPL")
4. Click "Analyze" button
5. Watch for:
   - AI predictions with confidence bounds
   - Support/resistance levels
   - Buy/sell signals
   - Real-time price updates

### Common Issues:
- If no data appears, the backend might be using mock data
- CORS errors are fixed (port 5174 added)
- Rate limits increased for development

### Components Updated:
- `AITradingChart.tsx` - Main chart with tabs and analyze button
- `advanced_ai_predictor.py` - Backend AI service (talib removed)
- `aiPredictionService.ts` - Frontend service calling new endpoint
- `useRealtimeChart.ts` - WebSocket hook for live updates

The chart should now be fully functional with the watermark visible!
