# GoldenSignalsAI V2 - Hybrid Sentiment System Documentation

## üöÄ Overview

The Hybrid Sentiment System represents a revolutionary approach to trading signal generation, combining independent agent analysis with collaborative intelligence. This system enhances the existing GoldenSignalsAI infrastructure with sophisticated sentiment analysis, divergence detection, and dynamic performance tracking.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Data Bus** (`agents/common/data_bus.py`)
   - Real-time publish/subscribe system
   - Time-based data expiration (TTL)
   - Thread-safe operations
   - Shared data types for price action, volume, market structure, and sentiment

2. **Hybrid Agent Base** (`agents/common/hybrid_agent_base.py`)
   - Dual signal generation (independent + collaborative)
   - Performance tracking for each approach
   - Divergence detection and scoring
   - Dynamic weight adjustment
   - Sentiment aggregation

3. **Hybrid Orchestrator** (`agents/orchestration/hybrid_orchestrator.py`)
   - Manages hybrid agents
   - Parallel execution
   - Divergence analysis
   - Performance dashboard
   - ML Meta Agent integration

4. **Enhanced ML Meta Agent** (`agents/meta/enhanced_ml_meta_agent.py`)
   - Ensemble optimization
   - Performance-based weight adjustment
   - Agent synergy detection

## ü§ñ Hybrid Agents

### Implemented Agents

1. **HybridRSIAgent**
   - Independent: Pure RSI analysis
   - Collaborative: RSI with volume, pattern, and support/resistance context

2. **HybridVolumeAgent**
   - Independent: Volume spike detection
   - Collaborative: Volume with pattern and momentum confirmation

3. **HybridMACDAgent**
   - Independent: MACD crossovers
   - Collaborative: MACD with volume and trend alignment

4. **HybridBollingerAgent**
   - Independent: Band touches
   - Collaborative: Bands with volume and regime context

5. **HybridPatternAgent**
   - Independent: Chart pattern recognition
   - Collaborative: Patterns with volume and trend confirmation

### Signal Components

Each hybrid agent generates signals with three components:
```python
{
    "independent": {
        "action": "BUY/SELL/HOLD",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "sentiment": "bullish/bearish/neutral"
    },
    "collaborative": {
        "action": "BUY/SELL/HOLD",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "sentiment": "bullish/bearish/neutral"
    },
    "final": {
        "action": "BUY/SELL/HOLD",
        "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
        "sentiment": "strong_bullish/bullish/neutral/bearish/strong_bearish"
    }
}
```

## üìä Data Sharing System

### SharedDataTypes

```python
{
    # Price Action Data
    "price_support_resistance": {"symbol": str, "levels": list, "timestamp": datetime},
    "price_trend_direction": {"symbol": str, "direction": str, "strength": float},
    "price_patterns": {"symbol": str, "patterns": list, "confidence": float},
    "price_key_levels": {"symbol": str, "levels": dict},
    
    # Volume Data
    "volume_profile": {"symbol": str, "profile": dict, "poc": float},
    "volume_spikes": {"symbol": str, "spikes": list, "significance": float},
    "volume_order_flow": {"symbol": str, "flow": dict, "imbalance": float},
    "volume_accumulation_distribution": {"symbol": str, "value": float, "trend": str},
    
    # Market Structure
    "market_regime": {"symbol": str, "regime": str, "confidence": float},
    "market_volatility_state": {"symbol": str, "state": str, "value": float},
    "market_liquidity_levels": {"symbol": str, "levels": dict},
    
    # Sentiment Data
    "sentiment_score": {"symbol": str, "score": float, "components": dict},
    "sentiment_options_flow": {"symbol": str, "bias": str, "magnitude": float},
    "sentiment_put_call_ratio": {"symbol": str, "ratio": float, "trend": str}
}
```

### Usage Example

```python
# Publishing data
agent.data_bus.publish('volume_spikes', {
    'symbol': 'AAPL',
    'spikes': [{'time': '10:30', 'volume': 1500000, 'price_change': 0.5}],
    'significance': 0.8,
    'timestamp': datetime.now()
})

# Subscribing to data
volume_data = agent.data_bus.get_latest('volume_spikes', 'AAPL')
```

## üîÑ Divergence Detection

### Types of Divergences

1. **Strong Divergence**: Independent and collaborative signals are opposite
   - Example: Independent=BUY, Collaborative=SELL
   - High contrarian opportunity potential

2. **Moderate Divergence**: Different signals but not opposite
   - Example: Independent=BUY, Collaborative=HOLD
   - Indicates uncertainty or transition

3. **Sentiment Divergence**: Same action but different sentiment
   - Example: Both BUY but Independent=bullish, Collaborative=strong_bullish
   - Shows conviction differences

### Divergence Scoring

```python
divergence_value = base_score * performance_multiplier * regime_factor

# Where:
# - base_score: 1.5 for strong, 1.2 for moderate, 1.0 for none
# - performance_multiplier: Historical success rate of divergences
# - regime_factor: Market regime suitability (1.3 in ranging, 0.8 in trending)
```

## üìà Performance Tracking

### Metrics Tracked

1. **Independent Performance**
   - Accuracy rate
   - Average return
   - Win/loss ratio

2. **Collaborative Performance**
   - Accuracy rate
   - Average return
   - Improvement over independent

3. **Divergence Performance**
   - Success rate when divergence detected
   - Optimal divergence types by market regime

### Weight Adjustment

Dynamic weights adjust between 0.3 and 0.7 based on:
```python
new_weight = base_weight + learning_rate * (performance - baseline)

# Constraints:
independent_weight + collaborative_weight = 1.0
0.3 <= weight <= 0.7
```

## üé≠ Sentiment Analysis

### Sentiment Levels

1. **strong_bullish**: High conviction bullish (> 80% confidence)
2. **bullish**: Moderate bullish (60-80% confidence)
3. **neutral**: No clear direction (40-60% confidence)
4. **bearish**: Moderate bearish (20-40% confidence)
5. **strong_bearish**: High conviction bearish (< 20% confidence)

### Market Sentiment Aggregation

```python
market_sentiment = {
    "overall": weighted_average_sentiment,
    "confidence": average_confidence,
    "agreement": percentage_of_agents_in_agreement,
    "breakdown": {
        "bullish": count_of_bullish_agents,
        "bearish": count_of_bearish_agents,
        "neutral": count_of_neutral_agents
    }
}
```
