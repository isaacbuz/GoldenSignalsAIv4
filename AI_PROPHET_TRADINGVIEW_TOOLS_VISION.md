## How Signals Are Formed

### 1. Market Structure Analysis
```
AI Prophet continuously analyzes:
- Overall trend direction
- Market volatility
- Key support/resistance levels
- Volume patterns
```

### 2. Pattern Detection
```
Multiple pattern types monitored:
- Chart patterns (triangles, flags, H&S)
- Candlestick patterns
- Trend line formations
- Fibonacci retracements
```

### 3. Confluence Calculation
```
Base Score: 50%
+ Fibonacci alignment: +15%
+ Trend line confirmation: +10%
+ Candlestick patterns: +8-9% each
+ Key level proximity: +2-10%
= Total Confluence Score (max 95%)
```

### 4. Signal Validation
```
High Confidence (>80%): Multiple confirmations align
Medium Confidence (60-80%): Moderate confirmations
Low Confidence (<60%): Limited confirmations
```
