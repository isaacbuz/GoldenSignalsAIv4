# GoldenSignalsAI v3 - Streamlined Architecture

## 🎯 Mission: Pure Signal Generation for Options Trading

**What We Are**: A focused signal generation system that tells traders when to enter and exit options positions.

**What We Are NOT**: 
- ❌ Portfolio management system
- ❌ Trade execution platform
- ❌ Brokerage integration
- ❌ Position tracking system
- ❌ P&L calculator

## 📊 Core Signal Output

Every signal contains exactly what an options trader needs:

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "signal": "BUY_CALL",      // BUY_CALL, BUY_PUT, or HOLD
  "confidence": 0.75,         // 0-1 confidence score
  "timeframe": "1-5 days",    // Expected holding period
  "current_price": 185.50,
  "entry_zone": [184.50, 186.50],  // Optimal entry range
  "exit_target": 192.00,      // Take profit level
  "stop_loss": 182.00,        // Risk management
  "risk_reward_ratio": 2.0,   // R:R calculation
  "reasoning": "RSI oversold + Support bounce + Volume spike"
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Adjust Signal Sensitivity
```python
# In signal generator
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6  # Minimum confidence
RSI_OVERSOLD = 30          # Oversold level
RSI_OVERBOUGHT = 70        # Overbought level
```

### Customize Timeframes
```python
# Short-term signals (1-5 days default)
SIGNAL_TIMEFRAME = "1-5 days"

# Can be adjusted for:
# - Scalping: "0-1 days"
# - Swing: "5-20 days"
# - Position: "20+ days"
```

## 📊 Example Use Cases

### 1. Morning Signal Check
```python
# Get all signals at market open
signals = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/signals").json()
for signal in signals:
    if signal['confidence'] > 0.7:
        print(f"{signal['symbol']}: {signal['signal']} ({signal['confidence']:.0%})")
```

### 2. Specific Stock Alert
```python
# Monitor specific stock
signal = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/signals/TSLA").json()
if signal['signal'] != 'HOLD':
    send_alert(f"TSLA Signal: {signal['signal']} at ${signal['current_price']}")
```

### 3. High Confidence Filter
```python
# Only show high confidence trades
all_signals = get_all_signals()
high_conf = [s for s in all_signals if s['confidence'] > 0.75]
```

## 🚨 Important Disclaimers

1. **Not Financial Advice**: Signals are for informational purposes only
2. **Risk Management**: Always use stop losses
3. **Position Sizing**: Never risk more than you can afford to lose
4. **Market Conditions**: Signals work best in trending markets
