# Frontend Import Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. TransformerAnalytics Import Path
- **Error**: Failed to resolve import "./components/Analytics/TransformerAnalytics"
- **Fix**: Already corrected to import from "./pages/Analytics/TransformerAnalytics"
- **Note**: This was likely a Vite cache issue

### 2. Portfolio Component Import
- **Error**: Failed to resolve import "./pages/Portfolio/Portfolio"
- **Fix**: Changed to import from "./pages/Portfolio/PortfolioPage"
- **File**: The actual component file is named PortfolioPage.tsx

### 3. Settings Component Import
- **Error**: Failed to resolve import "./pages/Settings/Settings"
- **Fix**: Changed to import from "./pages/Settings/SettingsPage"
- **File**: The actual component file is named SettingsPage.tsx

## Current Status
- All import paths have been corrected in AppRoutes.tsx
- Frontend server has been restarted to clear Vite cache
- The application should now load without import errors

## Files Modified
- `frontend/src/AppRoutes.tsx` - Fixed lazy loading imports for Portfolio and Settings components
