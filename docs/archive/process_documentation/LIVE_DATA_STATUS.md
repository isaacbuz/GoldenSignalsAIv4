# Live Data Status for GoldenSignalsAI

## ‚úÖ API Keys Status

All API keys have been tested and are working correctly:

- **yfinance**: ‚úÖ Working (no API key required)
- **Alpha Vantage**: ‚úÖ Working (Key: UBSR12WCJA...)
- **Polygon**: ‚úÖ Working (Key: aAAdnfA4lJ...)
- **Finnhub**: ‚úÖ Working (Key: d0ihu29r01...)

## üîß Implementation Details

### What Was Fixed

1. **Environment Variables Loading**
   - Added `dotenv` loading to both `simple_backend.py` and `simple_live_data.py`
   - API keys are now properly loaded from `.env` file

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - The original `live_data_connector.py` was trying to use `psycopg2` (sync) instead of `asyncpg` (async)
   - Created a simpler `simple_live_data.py` that uses yfinance directly without database dependencies

3. **Live Data Integration**
   - Real-time quotes are fetched from yfinance
   - Historical data is fetched from yfinance with proper interval conversion
   - Data is returned in the correct format expected by the frontend

### Current Status

‚úÖ **Working Features**:
- Live market data for individual symbols
- Historical data with configurable periods and intervals
- Real-time price updates
- Market opportunities endpoint
- Precise options signals

‚ö†Ô∏è **Using Mock Data**:
- Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, etc.) - currently returning random values
- Signal generation - still using mock signals
- AI insights - using placeholder data

## üìä Live Data Examples

### Market Data
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market-data/AAPL"
```
Returns real Apple stock data with current price, volume, high/low, etc.

### Historical Data
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/market-data/AAPL/historical?period=1d&interval=5m"
```
Returns real 5-minute candle data for the past day.

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Technical Indicators**
   - Implement real technical indicator calculations (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.)
   - Use TA-Lib or pandas_ta for calculations

2. **Signal Generation**
   - Connect ML models to generate real trading signals
   - Implement pattern recognition algorithms

3. **Database Integration**
   - Fix the async database driver issue
   - Store historical data for faster access
   - Implement signal history tracking

4. **Additional Data Sources**
   - Integrate Alpha Vantage for fundamental data
   - Use Polygon for real-time WebSocket feeds
   - Add Finnhub for news sentiment

5. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement caching with Redis
   - Add rate limiting for API calls
   - Batch requests where possible

## üìù Notes

- The system gracefully falls back to mock data when live data is unavailable
- All timestamps are properly handled with timezone awareness
- The frontend is receiving and displaying the live data correctly
- WebSocket connections are established but still sending mock signals
