## üîß Testing Instructions

1. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:3000
   - The main dashboard should load

2. **Enable AI Mode**
   - Click the Layers icon (indicators)
   - Scroll to "AI FEATURES"
   - Toggle "AI Mode" on

3. **Test Auto Mode**
   - Select "Auto" from dropdown
   - AI should start analyzing immediately
   - Analysis runs every 30 seconds

4. **Test Manual Mode**
   - Select "Manual" from dropdown
   - Click "Analyze" button
   - Watch the AI thinking panel

5. **Verify Visualizations**
   - Support/Resistance lines appear
   - Fibonacci levels are drawn
   - Patterns are detected and shown

## üìù Known Issues

1. **Chart Library Compatibility**
   - Some drawing functions may need adjustment based on the specific chart library used
   - Line series might accumulate if not properly cleaned up

2. **Performance**
   - Multiple AI analyses might slow down the chart
   - Consider implementing cleanup for old drawings

3. **Mock Data**
   - Currently using mock patterns and levels
   - Need to integrate with real AI backend

## üéâ Conclusion

The AI Lab functionality has been successfully integrated into the main dashboard. Users now have access to powerful AI analysis tools without leaving their primary trading interface. The implementation provides a solid foundation for further enhancements and creates a more cohesive trading experience.
