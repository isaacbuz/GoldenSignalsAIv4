## Immediate Next Steps

### This Week
1. **Fix Data Pipeline**
   ```bash
   # Install additional data sources
   pip install alpha-vantage pandas-datareader yfinance
   
   # Test each source
   python test_all_data_sources.py
   ```

2. **Start Historical Data Collection**
   ```python
   # Begin downloading 20 years for top symbols
   python scripts/download_historical_data.py --years 20 --symbols SP500
   ```

3. **Set Up Database**
   ```bash
   # Install TimescaleDB
   docker run -d --name timescaledb -p 5432:5432 \
     -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
     timescale/timescaledb:latest-pg14
   ```

### Next Week
1. Begin feature engineering pipeline
2. Start model experimentation with subset
3. Set up MLflow for experiment tracking

## Resources Needed

### Compute
- Training: 32-core CPU, 128GB RAM, GPU (optional)
- Inference: 8-core CPU, 32GB RAM
- Storage: 1TB SSD for historical data

### Budget Estimate
- Cloud compute: $500-1000/month
- Data APIs: $200-500/month
- Total: ~$1500/month for production

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Data Vendor Lock-in**
   - Maintain multiple data sources
   - Regular data backups
   - Standardized data format

2. **Model Overfitting**
   - Strict out-of-sample testing
   - Regular retraining
   - Simple baseline models

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - Unit tests for all components
   - Code reviews

## Conclusion

The current 2-year model training is a successful proof of concept. To achieve production-grade performance with institutional-quality signals, we need:

1. **20 years of clean data** across 500+ symbols
2. **100+ engineered features** including alternative data
3. **Advanced model architectures** with ensemble methods
4. **Rigorous backtesting** across multiple market regimes
5. **Scalable infrastructure** with monitoring

The complete implementation will take approximately 8 weeks with a dedicated team and ~$1500/month in infrastructure costs.
