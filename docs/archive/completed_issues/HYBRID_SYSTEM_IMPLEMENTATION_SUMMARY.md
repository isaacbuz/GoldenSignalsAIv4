- Tests for functionality, divergence, sentiment, performance
- Pretty-printed signal analysis
- Performance simulation

#### 9. **Documentation**
- `HYBRID_SENTIMENT_SYSTEM.md` - Complete system documentation
- This summary file

### Key Features Implemented

#### **Data Sharing**
- Real-time data bus with TTL
- Standard data types for interoperability
- Thread-safe publish/subscribe

#### **Sentiment Analysis**
- 5-level sentiment scale (strong_bullish to strong_bearish)
- Market-wide sentiment aggregation
- Sentiment trend detection
- Options flow and institutional tracking

#### **Divergence Detection**
- Strong divergences (opposite signals)
- Moderate divergences (different signals)
- Sentiment divergences (conviction differences)
- Dynamic scoring based on performance

#### **Performance Tracking**
- Independent vs collaborative accuracy
- Divergence success rates
- Dynamic weight adjustment
- Agent synergy detection

#### **API Endpoints**
- `/api/v1/hybrid/signals/{symbol}` - Get hybrid signals
- `/api/v1/hybrid/sentiment/{symbol}` - Sentiment analysis
- `/api/v1/hybrid/performance` - Performance dashboard
- `/api/v1/hybrid/divergences` - Divergence analysis
- `/api/v1/hybrid/agents` - List active agents
- `ws://api/v1/hybrid/ws` - Real-time updates

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Best of both worlds: pure analysis + collaborative intelligence
   - Captures contrarian opportunities through divergences
   - Adapts to changing market conditions

2. **Dynamic Adaptation**
   - Weights adjust based on performance
   - Market regime awareness
   - Time-of-day considerations

3. **Rich Metadata**
   - Every signal includes sentiment analysis
   - Divergence detection highlights opportunities
   - Performance metrics guide improvements

4. **Scalability**
   - Modular agent design
   - Parallel execution
   - Data bus prevents tight coupling

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Signal Generation
```python
orchestrator = HybridOrchestrator(symbols=['AAPL', 'TSLA'])
signal = orchestrator.generate_signals_for_symbol('AAPL')
```

#### Sentiment Analysis
```python
sentiment = orchestrator.get_sentiment_analysis('AAPL')
market_sentiment = sentiment['market_sentiment']['overall']  # 'bullish', 'bearish', 'neutral'
```

#### Performance Tracking
```python
orchestrator.update_agent_performance('rsi', 'signal_123', 1.0)  # Win
dashboard = orchestrator.get_performance_dashboard()
```

### Testing
Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python test_hybrid_system.py
```

### Integration with Main API
The hybrid system is integrated into the main FastAPI application at `/api/v1/hybrid/*` endpoints.

### Future Enhancements Possible

1. **Machine Learning**
   - Deep learning for pattern recognition
   - Reinforcement learning for weight optimization
   - Advanced regime detection

2. **Additional Data Sources**
   - News sentiment integration
   - Social media analysis
   - Economic indicators

3. **Risk Management**
   - Position sizing based on divergence
   - Dynamic stop-loss adjustment
   - Portfolio-level optimization

### Conclusion

The Hybrid Sentiment System represents a significant advancement in the GoldenSignalsAI platform. By combining independent analysis with collaborative intelligence, tracking performance, and detecting divergences, the system provides more robust and adaptable trading signals while identifying unique market opportunities.

The implementation leverages Claude Opus MAX capabilities to create a sophisticated, production-ready system that can evolve and improve over time through its built-in learning mechanisms.
