./start_frontend_local.sh

# Backend (needs dependency fixes)

# Or manually:
cd frontend && npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

To get the full application running:
1. Fix backend dependencies
2. Start the backend server
3. Connect frontend to backend API

The frontend is fully functional with mock data, so you can explore the UI and all the features we've built!
