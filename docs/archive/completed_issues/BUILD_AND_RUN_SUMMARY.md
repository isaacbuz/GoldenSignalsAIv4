# GoldenSignalsAI Build and Run Summary

## Current Status

### ✅ Completed
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Python virtual environment is activated (`.venv`)
   - PostgreSQL and Redis are running
   - All required environment variables are set in `.env`

2. **Backend Status**
   - Backend dependencies are installed
   - Backend can start successfully using `simple_backend.py`
   - API is accessible at http://localhost:8000/docs when running

3. **Frontend Status**
   - Frontend dependencies are installed
   - Development server can start with Vite

### ❌ Issues to Fix

1. **useWebSocket.ts Syntax Error**
   - File has persistent JSX syntax errors at line 192
   - Contains malformed style attribute: `style= {{` instead of `style={{`
   - Multiple attempts to fix have been unsuccessful due to duplicate content

2. **TypeScript Build Errors**
   - TypeScript compilation fails due to the useWebSocket.ts syntax error
   - This prevents production builds

## How to Build and Run

### Quick Start (Development Mode)
```bash
# From project root
./start.sh
```

This will:
- Check prerequisites
- Start PostgreSQL and Redis
- Start the backend on http://localhost:8000
- Start the frontend on http://localhost:3000

### Manual Start
```bash
# Backend
cd /path/to/project
source .venv/bin/activate
python simple_backend.py

# Frontend (in new terminal)
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### Docker Build (Alternative)
```bash
# Build all services
docker-compose build

# Run all services
docker-compose up
```

## Next Steps to Fix

1. **Fix useWebSocket.ts**
   - The file has duplicate malformed JSX content
   - Need to completely remove and recreate the file with correct syntax
   - Ensure no spaces after `style=` in JSX attributes

2. **Verify Other Files**
   - Check for similar syntax errors in other TypeScript/React files
   - Run full TypeScript compilation after fixing

3. **Complete Build**
   - Once syntax errors are fixed, run `npm run build` in frontend
   - Deploy using Docker or production scripts

## Useful Commands

```bash
# Check service status
./start.sh status

# View logs
./start.sh logs backend
./start.sh logs frontend

# Stop all services
./start.sh stop

# Clean and restart
./start.sh stop
./start.sh clean
./start.sh
```

## Architecture Overview

The project uses:
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) with live data connectors
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for persistence
- **Cache**: Redis for real-time data
- **WebSocket**: For real-time updates between frontend and backend

The main issue preventing full deployment is the syntax error in the WebSocket hook file, which needs to be manually corrected.
