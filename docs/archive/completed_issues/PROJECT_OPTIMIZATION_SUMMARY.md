## 🔍 Critical Issues Identified & Solutions

### 1. **Architecture Issues** 🚨

#### **Problem**: Monolithic Signal Engine (1,372 lines)
```python
# Current: domain/signal_engine.py (1,372 lines)
# CRITICAL: This file is too large and complex
```

#### **Solution**: Modular Decomposition
```python
# Proposed structure:
domain/
├── signal_engine/
│   ├── core/
│   │   ├── signal_processor.py      # Core logic (200 lines)
│   │   ├── validation_engine.py    # Validation (150 lines)
│   │   └── confidence_calculator.py # Scoring (100 lines)
│   ├── analyzers/
│   │   ├── technical_analyzer.py   # Technical analysis (250 lines)
│   │   ├── options_analyzer.py     # Options analysis (200 lines)
│   │   └── sentiment_analyzer.py   # Sentiment analysis (150 lines)
│   └── strategies/
│       ├── setup_detector.py       # Setup detection (200 lines)
│       └── risk_manager.py         # Risk management (150 lines)
```

### 2. **Performance Bottlenecks** 🐌

#### **Problem**: Synchronous Database Operations
```python
# Current: Blocking database calls in signal generation
def generate_signal():
    data = fetch_data(symbol)  # BLOCKING!
    result = process_data(data)
    return result
```

#### **Solution**: Async/Await Architecture
```python
# Optimized: Parallel async operations
async def generate_signal_async():
    market_data, options_data, news_data = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_market_data_async(symbol),
        fetch_options_data_async(symbol),
        fetch_news_data_async(symbol)
    )
    return await process_data_async(combined_data)
```

### 3. **Testing Gaps** 🧪

#### **Problem**: Limited Test Coverage for New Agents
- New agents lack comprehensive unit tests
- No load testing for concurrent scenarios
- Missing integration tests for WebSocket functionality

#### **Solution**: Comprehensive Test Suite
```python
# Implemented: Full test coverage
tests/
├── unit/agents/
│   ├── test_gamma_exposure_agent.py ✅
│   ├── test_skew_agent.py (needed)
│   └── test_meta_consensus_agent.py (needed)
├── integration/
│   ├── test_signal_pipeline.py (needed)
│   └── test_websocket_streaming.py (needed)
└── performance/
    ├── test_load_performance.py ✅
    └── test_memory_usage.py (needed)
```
