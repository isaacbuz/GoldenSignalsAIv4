### 2. Continuous Deployment (`cd.yml`)
Automated deployment with safety measures:

#### Deployment Strategy:
1. **Staging Deployment**
   - Automatic from main branch
   - Helm chart deployment
   - Smoke tests validation

   - 15-minute monitoring period
   - Automatic rollback on failure
   - CDN cache invalidation
   - GitHub release creation

4. **Rollback Mechanism**
   - Automatic on deployment failure
   - Helm rollback to previous release
   - Team notifications

### 3. Security Scanning (`security.yml`)
Comprehensive security checks:

#### Security Jobs:
1. **CodeQL Analysis**
   - Python and JavaScript scanning
   - Security and quality queries

2. **Dependency Scanning**
   - Trivy for vulnerabilities
   - Safety for Python packages
   - npm audit for Node packages

3. **Container Security**
   - Docker image scanning
   - Backend and frontend images
   - SARIF reporting

4. **Secret Detection**
   - TruffleHog for history
   - GitLeaks for current code

5. **License Compliance**
   - Approved license checking
   - Fail on GPL/proprietary

6. **OWASP Checks**
   - Comprehensive dependency analysis
   - Known vulnerability detection

## Supporting Scripts Created

### 1. Smoke Tests (`scripts/smoke-tests.sh`)
- **Features**:
  - All critical endpoint testing
  - WebSocket connectivity check
  - Response time validation
  - Retry logic (3 attempts)

  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage

- **Features**:
  - 30-second check intervals
  - Fail-fast on 3 consecutive failures
  - Simulated metrics for testing
  - Production-ready structure

### 3. Load Testing (`tests/performance/locustfile.py`)

  - Regular users (standard patterns)
  - Power users (aggressive usage)
  - Mobile users (slower patterns)

- **Test Scenarios**:
  - Signal checking
  - Market data retrieval
  - Historical data analysis
