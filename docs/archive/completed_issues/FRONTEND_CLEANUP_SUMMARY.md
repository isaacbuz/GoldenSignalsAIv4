# Frontend Cleanup Summary

## Date: June 17, 2025

### What Was Done:
1. **Removed `frontend-v2` folder** - This was an experimental redesign that was never completed
2. **Updated VSCode settings** - Changed references from `frontend-v2` to `frontend`
3. **Removed obsolete scripts** - Deleted `start-live-preview.sh` which referenced the removed folder

### Current State:
- **Active Frontend**: `frontend/` (version 3.0.0)
- **All features working**: Including the new AI Signal Prophet
- **Clean project structure**: No duplicate or abandoned code

### Remaining References:
The following documentation files still reference `frontend-v2` but are historical records:
- FRONTEND_REDESIGN_SUMMARY.md
- LIVE_PREVIEW_GUIDE.md
- FRONTEND_REDESIGN_EVALUATION.md
- FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md

These can be kept for historical context or removed if not needed.
