## Why This Happened

1. **Bulk Closure**: It appears all issues #209-#216 were bulk closed, possibly:
   - During project board reorganization
   - As part of a milestone completion
   - Accidentally when managing issues

2. **Automation Effects**: Our CI/CD setup triggered:
   - Dependabot creating dependency update PRs
   - Test plan creating new testing issues

## Recommended Actions

1. **Reopen Unfinished Issues**:
   - #210: Agent System Unit Testing (in progress)

   - #235: Create Unit Tests for Agents (high priority)

3. **Review Dependabot PRs**:
   - Merge safe dependency updates
