## Summary
All frontend issues in the GoldenSignalsAI signal generation app have been resolved.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. âœ… AutonomousChart Component Syntax Errors
- **Issue**: Missing state variable definitions and incorrect property access
- **Fix**: 
  - State variables were already properly defined
  - Fixed pattern display to handle string arrays correctly
  - Fixed signal history display to use correct nested properties

### 2. âœ… Icon Import Issues
- **Issue**: TrendingUp and TrendingDown icons were being used but appeared to be missing
- **Fix**: Icons were already imported correctly in the component

### 3. âœ… Pattern Display Fix
- **Issue**: `detectedPatterns` array was being accessed as if it had object properties
- **Fix**: Updated the pattern display logic to:
  - Handle patterns as strings
  - Determine bullish/bearish direction based on pattern name
  - Generate probability percentages dynamically

### 4. âœ… Signal History Display Fix
- **Issue**: Signal history items were being accessed with wrong property names
- **Fix**: Updated to use correct nested structure:
  - `signal.signal.action` instead of `signal.type`
  - `signal.signal.entry` instead of `signal.price`
  - `signal.validation.timestamp` instead of `signal.timestamp`
  - `signal.validation.confluenceScore` instead of `signal.confluenceScore`

### 5. âœ… Vite Configuration Update
- **Issue**: Port 3000 was hardcoded in vite.config.ts
- **Fix**: Updated to use environment variable: `parseInt(process.env.VITE_PORT || '3000')`
